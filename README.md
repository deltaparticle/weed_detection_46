# Weed Detection using Semi-Supervised Learning

## Abstract

Weed detection plays a critical role in agricultural automation, helping optimize crop yields while minimizing herbicide usage. Traditional supervised learning methods require large labeled datasets, which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. In this project, we explore a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach for weed detection, where a small amount of labeled data is augmented with a larger pool of unlabeled data. The YOLOv8 model was employed to predict weed locations in images, with a training pipeline that combined both labeled and pseudo-labeled data.
